Let multiple gmail users verfiy themselves for this drive app to manage their data,

when a request is made to Drive for any of the operation, token.pickle is used. 
We can store multiple accounts creds with multiple token.pickle. 
Just at the time of sending the request, rename one of the randomly selected file
to be token.pickle, and bingo!
Make the call, and it should all work just fine.
